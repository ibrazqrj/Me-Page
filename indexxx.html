              <p>My venture into the realm of technology commenced subsequent to my initial apprenticeship as a retail specialist at the Swiss Post. Although I'm relatively new to computer science, I approach it with enthusiasm and a desire to delve deeper into the field. I'm eager, open-minded, and excited about the boundless possibilities that technology offers.</p>
              <p>Currently a customer service representative at a Swiss bank, I aim to transition into a role as a computer scientist specializing in application development. This marks my first step toward a career in the tech industry, driven by my commitment to learning and advancement.</p>
